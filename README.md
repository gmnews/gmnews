## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Entertainment, News, Utilities, and Producivity**
- **Mobile: Pretty mobile, easy to use anywhere**
- **Story: This product has great value for people who want to kickstart their morning, by having important information available to them in one place.**
- **Market: The market is college students and more professional people. It's mostly for anyone who is looking to be more productive in the morning.**
- **Habit: Every day in the morning.**
- **Scope: Technically speaking, the logic running the app is not too intense. However, making it look attractive will be where our troubles will arise. A stripped down version, with only a news stream, would still be interesting. The vision we have for the product is crystal clear, and we are excited to bring it to market.**
